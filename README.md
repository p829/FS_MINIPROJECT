IMAGE COMPRESSION USING K_MEANS ALGORITHM

The  K-means  algorithm can be  used to  compress the  image.  Unlike lossless compression,  K-means uses lossy compression, so it is not possible to recover the original image from the compressed image. Larger the  compression  ratio,  the larger  the difference  between the  compressed  image and  the original image. 

I have implemented Image compression using K-Means algorithm, Python, Numpy and Pillow. I have also created simple, basic GUI using Tkinter in Python.

Requirements to run the code:

Python 3.6.
Tkinter.
NumPy.
Pillow.

How to use the code:

Import Numpy, Pillow, Tkinter packages.
Open the both im_comp.py and dem.py in any editor.
Run dem.py.
Follow the instructions as writter on the window displayed.
Enter the absolute path of the image you want to compress.(only png files)
Enter K value .
Enter the NO_OF_ITERATIONS.
Click compress button.
Original image is displayed and after a few mintues, compressed image is also displayed.
Check the window for all the details.
